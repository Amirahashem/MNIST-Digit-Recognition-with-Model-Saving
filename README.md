# Digit Recognition using TensorFlow with Model Saving

This project builds a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, with added functionality to save the trained model and load it later for predictions.

## Project Overview

- Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset.  
- Builds a Sequential model with Flatten and Dense layers.  
- Trains the model for 3 epochs.  
- Saves the trained model in `.h5` or `.keras` format.  
- Loads the saved model to make predictions on test data.  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- NumPy  

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:  
2. Run the training script to train and save the model.  
3. Run the prediction script to load the saved model and make predictions.

## Results
The model achieves 97% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.
